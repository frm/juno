# Juno

**⚠️ Beware: here be dragons. This is an evolving project.**

Juno is my starter project. It comes bundled with a bunch of goodies out of the
box so I don't have to write a ton of boilerplate code.

## Goodies

- `bin/` scripts so you don't have to go through hassles of setting up
- `asdf` and `direnv` prepared
- GraphQL and Absinthe set up with Google OAuth
- S3 file upload set up
